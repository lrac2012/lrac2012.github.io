	<p>
	  I teach Piano, Ukulele and Guitar from beginner to
	  intermediate, young children to adults. I have taught
	  private music lessons since 2013. Prior to teaching lessons,
	  I worked in early childhood education and also have co-run a
	  music / art summer camp.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My teaching is based on a foundation in music theory,
	  technique and history. I use several different books and
	  methods in addition to always incorporating new material. I
	  teach from a classical foundation but equally draw upon folk,
	  blues and popular music, as I believe it's important to expose
	  my students to different methods, styles, and genres. This
	  could mean working on a classical piece, drawing upon the song
	  cannon, or incorporating the voice with playing. Eventually we
	  might dabble in songwriting or improvisation if the student
	  has any interest.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  I also teach songwriting and improvisation specifically for
	  the student that wants to focus on one of those. I am
	  available for virtual lessons for students outside of the
	  Portland area.

	  I teach written music as well as playing by ear. As a
	  musician, having a strong ear is the most important asset,
	  but I want my students to have fluidity between being on or
	  off the page. My goal with each student is to set them up
	  with solid fundamentals of technique, posture, and a
	  well-tuned ear, while inspiring their curiosity, creativity
	  and individuality. Every student is unique and I strive to
	  help each one find their own musical path. I believe in the
	  power and importance of music and the creative expression in
	  the everyday.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I graduated with a BA in Music from The College of Santa Fe
	  in NM and I have studied everything from classical, folk,
	  jazz, improvisation, computer music, and rock. I also play
	  the viola, kantele and drums. In my free time I have written
	  songs and and recorded albums, as well as played in a
	  various bands in addition to many more musical adventures.
