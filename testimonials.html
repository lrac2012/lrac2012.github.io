	<h4> Kelly G.</h4>
	<p>
	Three of our four family members took lessons from Carl for
	several years, and he successfully covered the teaching
	spectrum from age 5 to adult.  Carl has a special talent for
	selecting music that is fun and interesting to play, even
	during the early lessons with just a few chords.  Our kids
	learned to play guitar and ukulele, but they also learned to
	appreciate different music styles and sounds, and especially
	to appreciate how much talent really goes into a song by The
	Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, or Johnny Cash.  Listening to the
	radio in the car became a new experience, with questions and
	comments about the instruments, rhythm, sound, and different
	parts of a song.  Carl took the time with both kids over the
	years to teach them songs to play at school talent shows, for
	school book reports, or for a special birthday.  Listening to
	them practice and grow musically was a real joy, and we are
	grateful to Carl's passion for teaching and dedication to his
	students.
	</p>


	<h4> From the parents: Brian S. and Claire S.</h4>
	<p>
	  We have two kids.  Our oldest started working with Carl and
	  enjoyed it/learned a ton.  So when it came time for our
	  youngest child to start lessons, we signed her up with Carl
	  as well.  We consistently hear from our kids that he is kind
	  and patient.  He also adapted well to remote learning during
	  the pandemic.  And we have seen tremendous progress from
	  each of our kids in their understanding of the instrument
	  (piano) and ability to read music.  Learning from Carl
	  helped our oldest child transition well into a middle school
	  band program, and we believe it has helped both of them with
	  their appreciation of music generally.

	<h4>June</h4>
	<p>
	  Carl lets you go as slow as you need and, when learning
	  songs, he asks if you feel good about moving on or not.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Eddie</h4>
	<p>
	  Carl gives you small things to write on your practice
	  sheet that can help you know what parts of your music to
	  focus on. This helps you fine-tune your music and skills.
	</p>

	<h4>Harrison M.</h4>
	<p>
	  Our son Neil started taking piano lessons with Carl when he
	  was seven years old.  When younger, Neil was often
	  squirrelly, and Carl's patience and bag of tricks were
	  always enough to get Neil ready and focused for learning.
	  Neil enjoyed performing at Carl's yearly recitals.  Over
	  eight years of seeing Neil and the other kids perform at
	  recitals, we saw great growth in all of the students (not
	  only our son's); it was evident that Carl individualizes his
	  music education to each student, as seen in the depth and
	  variety of musical pieces performed each year.  Neil says
	  that Carl was always great at helping him get past a problem
	  or place that he was stuck. And, also he said that Carl
	  always knew the right time to move on from working to master
	  one piece to starting the next.  Whatever our son does with
	  piano and music in his life, he will have a very solid
	  foundation to build upon thanks to Carl's guidance.
	</p>

	<h4>Cate K.</h4>
	<p>
	  Our children (ages 6 and 8.5) started with Carl when they
	  were 5 and 7. They have both progressed so well while taking
	  lessons. Carl has a calm, encouraging demeanor that really
	  works well for our kids. They feel proud of the music they
	  have learned and love showing off for friends.
