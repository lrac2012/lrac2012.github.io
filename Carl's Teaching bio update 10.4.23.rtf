I teach Piano, Ukulele and Guitar from beginner to intermediate, young children to adults. I have taught private music lessons since 2013. Prior to teaching lessons, I worked in early childhood education and also have co-run a music / art summer camp.\
\
My teaching is based on a foundation in music theory, technique and history. I use several different books and methods in addition to always incorporating new material. I teach from a classical foundation but equally draw upon folk, blues and popular music, as I believe it\'92s important to expose my students to different methods, styles, and genres. This could mean working on a classical piece, drawing upon the song cannon, or incorporating the voice with playing. Eventually we might dabble in songwriting or improvisation if the student has any interest.\
\
I also teach songwriting, music theory and improvisation specifically for the student that wants to focus on one of those. I am available for virtual lessons for students outside of the Portland area.\

\cf2 I teach written music as well as playing by ear. As a musician, having a strong ear is the most important asset, but I want my students to have fluidity between being on or off the page. My goal with each student is to set them up with solid fundamentals of technique, posture, and music theory. In addition to teaching them \'91how to practice\'92 and importantly how to have a \'91growth mindset\'92. All the while I also hope to inspire their curiosity, creativity and individuality. Every student is unique and I strive to help each one find their own musical path. I believe in the power and importance of music and the creative expression in the everyday.\
\
I graduated with a BA in Music from The College of Santa Fe in NM and I have studied everything from classical, folk, jazz, improvisation, computer music, and rock. I also play the viola, kantele and drums. In my free time I have written songs, played in various bands, and have recorded albums, in addition to many more musical adventures.\
